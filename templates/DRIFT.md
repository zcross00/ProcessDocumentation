# {{Project Name}} — Drift Log

This document catalogs implementations that work against the user's stated goals. Drift is a measure of how far the project's actual state has diverged from the intended direction.

An implementation qualifies as drift when it:
- **Harms** a goal's chance of success
- **Contradicts** what a goal intends
- **Does not further** any goal while consuming project resources or adding complexity

Drift is not a bug list. Bugs are defects in intended behavior. Drift is correct behavior that moves the project in the wrong direction relative to its goals.

<!-- section: rules -->
## Rules

- **No duplicate entries.** If additional instances of the same drift are found, add them to the existing item's Instances section.
- **Every entry links to a goal.** Drift is defined relative to goals — if it doesn't affect a goal, it's not drift.
- **Resolution creates a backlog item.** When drift is identified, create a corresponding `BL-N` item in BACKLOG.md to address it.
